Wordpress Geospatial Framework
==============================

Extensible plugin to support the incorporation of complex geospatial data into wordpress.

This plugin relies on several mapping libraries:
- The GeoPHP plugin from @phayes
- OpenLayers and openlayers-editor
- MySQL geometry data types (native in MySQL 5)

Disclaimer: this plugin is currently in a ridiculously early and non-functional state.
